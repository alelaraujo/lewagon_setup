## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your Terminal

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one.

```bash
# it will ask for your session password
sudo apt install -y zsh curl vim nodejs imagemagick jq
```
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

At then end, your terminal should look like this:

If it doesn't, **ask a teacher**.
