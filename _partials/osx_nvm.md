## Installing Node (with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm))

```bash
brew install nvm
```

Restart your terminal and run the following:

```bash
nvm -v
```
You should see a version. If not, ask a teacher.

Now let's install node:

```bash
nvm install 14.15.0
```

When the command returns, run

```bash
node -v
```

You should see `v14.15.0`. If not, ask a teacher.
