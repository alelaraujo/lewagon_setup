## Git

To install `git`, first open a terminal. To open a terminal, you can click on the Ubuntu Start button in the sidebar and type `Terminal`. Then click on the terminal icon.

Then copy this line with `Ctrl` + `C`:

```bash
sudo apt install -y git
```

:bulb: To **paste it in the terminal**, you need to use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `V`.


Let's now install GitHub [official CLI](https://cli.github.com) (Command Line Interface) with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y gh
```

To check that `gh` has been successfully installed on your machine, you can run:

```bash
gh --version
```

If you don't get a prompt saying `gh version X.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)` with at least version 1.4, please refer to [the documentation](https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#official-sources) where they list some troubleshooting information. In doubt, ask a TA.
